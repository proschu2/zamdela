I started to find other places in town, where we could do our murals in public spaces. So these mural projects around town became a way to reach out to kids that would randomly pass by and ask us what we do. We would tell them about the art center and anybody could join to paint the mural with us. This is how we raise awareness about our work.</i><footer>&nbsp;~ Gilbert Maepa, Artist and Activist at the Art Center</footer>",
